# Translating Resonus

Thanks for helping translate Resonus! If anything here is unclear, open an issue
or ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hpDfszr8r).

## How translations work

- The **English text is the key**. Each language has a JSON file in
  `src/i18n/locales/` mapping the English string to its translation.
- Anything not translated falls back to English, so a partial file is fine.
- `{name}`, `{n}`, etc. are **placeholders** — keep them exactly as-is; they get
  replaced at runtime. Only translate the words around them.
- JSON can't hold comments, so the per-string context lives in this file (see
  [String context](#string-context) below), not in the `.json`.

## Adding a new language

1. Create `src/i18n/locales/<code>.json` (English key → your translation).
2. Add one row to `LANGUAGES` in `src/i18n/languages.ts`: import your JSON and
   add `{ code: '<code>', name: '<native name>', dict: <import> }`. That's the
   single source of truth — the `Language` type, the display names, the settings
   picker and the persistence all derive from it, so **nothing else needs
   touching**.
3. Only if your language needs **more than 2** plural forms (one / other): add
   its forms to `PLURALS` and its rule to `PLURAL_RULE` in `src/i18n/index.ts`
   (see [Plurals](#plurals)).

Prefer not to touch the code? Just add the `.json` and open the PR — we'll add
the one-line row for you.

## Adapt for what sounds natural

**A good translation reads naturally, it isn't literal.** If a word-for-word
translation would sound odd, adapt it — stay close to the original *meaning*, not
the wording.

For example, "Quick grid" or "chips" needn't map to the literal words for
"grid"/"chip" if those sound wrong — an equivalent like "Quick access" is fine,
and folding a couple of UI terms into one natural word is welcome.

## Plurals

Counted strings like "3 songs" use per-language plural forms, not a single
template, so each language can inflect the noun correctly.

- Most languages need **2 forms** (one / other): English, Spanish, Catalan,
  German are set up this way in `PLURALS`.
- Some need **more**. Russian, for instance, needs **3** (one / few / many).
  The system supports this: give as many forms as your language's rule uses in
  `PLURALS`, and register the rule in `PLURAL_RULE` (`src/i18n/index.ts`).

Russian rule (CLDR):

| Category | When | Example counts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| one  | `n%10 == 1 && n%100 != 11` | 1, 21, 31 |
| few  | `n%10` in 2–4 && `n%100` not in 12–14 | 2, 3, 4, 22 |
| many | everything else | 0, 5–20, 25 |

If a `{n}` string **baked into the JSON** (not one of the counted labels above)
doesn't inflect correctly in your language, **list it in your PR or an issue** —
we'll move it into the plural system so it can be inflected properly.

## Gendered / context-dependent words

A single English key sometimes maps to several words in another language
depending on gender or context. English `About` is one word, but Russian needs
a different one for *About the artist* vs *About the app*.

You don't have to burden every language with that. Most languages just translate
the **base key** (`About`) once and it's used everywhere. If *your* language
needs to distinguish a specific use, add an **override key** shaped
`Base::context` — only in your file; other languages keep just the base:

```jsonc
"About": "Подробности",        // base — the fallback for every use
"About::artist": "Об исполнителе",  // used only on the artist screen
"About::app": "О приложении"        // used only on the About-app screen
```

The app looks up the `::context` key first and falls back to the base if you
didn't add it, so overrides are always optional. Contexts available today:

| Override key | Where it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `About::artist` | Artist screen: the **biography** section title |
| `About::app` | Settings → the **About this app** page title |

If a base key needs a context that doesn't exist yet, tell us and we'll add it.

## Checking what's left to translate

Run the status script to see, per language, how much is done and exactly which
strings are still missing:

```
pnpm i18n:status              # summary table for every language
pnpm i18n:status ru           # details for one language (missing / same / stale)
pnpm i18n:status --todo ru    # just the untranslated keys, one per line
```

- **missing** — the key isn't in your file yet (it falls back to English).
- **same** — present but identical to the English text (sometimes that's correct,
  e.g. "Radio"; otherwise it still needs translating).
- **stale** — a key in your file that no longer exists in English; safe to delete.

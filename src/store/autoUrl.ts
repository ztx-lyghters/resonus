/**
 * Server profile network reliability: URL switching and fallback to offline
 * mode, both automatic on connectivity change.
 *
 * A profile can have multiple URLs for the same account (local IP, domain,
 * Tailscale…). On network change —leaving home: Wi-Fi → mobile— active URLs are
 * probed (local network ones first) and the first reachable one is activated.
 * The Wi-Fi SSID is not read (avoids requesting location permission): we are
 * guided by who responds, which is enough because the local IP is only reachable
 * at home.
 *
 * Additionally, if NO URL responds and the user has downloads, it falls back to
 * offline mode (show/play downloads) without them having to do anything; and
 * when the server responds again, it auto-reconnects. This makes downloads
 * "just work" without managing modes. A manual offline is not reverted (only
 * what auto-activated is auto-reconnected: `autoOffline`).

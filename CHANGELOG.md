# Changelog

All notable changes to Resonus are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Releases before 0.2.1 are only listed on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/juananzzz/resonus/releases).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Per-library visibility toggles for multi-library servers: pick which
  Navidrome libraries appear across the app (Home, Library, Search, Favorites).
- 1–5 star rating bar in the player (opt-in; off by default).
- Grid view mode for the Library.
- New Theme settings section with an accent color picker.
- German translation.
- Loading skeletons on the Genres screen and the browse and home album/artist
  lists.

### Changed

- The audio quality label is now a player-only toggle instead of appearing on
  every song row.
- Audio fades in and out when you pause or resume inside the app.
- More breathing room between the settings section rows.

### Fixed

- Shuffle play could show a different track than the one actually playing, and
  the shuffle button stayed lit on unrelated albums and playlists.
- The About screen no longer labels the version as beta.

### Removed

- Chromecast support, removing the last proprietary dependency (a step toward
  F-Droid). Casting to UPnP/DLNA devices is unaffected.

[0.2.2]: https://github.com/juananzzz/resonus/releases/tag/v0.2.2

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Tap the cover art in the player to open the full-screen lyrics.
- Artist picker for songs and albums with more than one artist.
- Loading skeleton for the genre cards in Search.

### Changed

- Reworked the mini player gestures: swipe down to dismiss, swipe sideways to
  skip tracks.
- Split the queue into clear sections (now playing, next in queue, next from
  the source).
- Polished the lyrics screen with Apple Music-style line focus and previous /
  next controls.
- Full-screen lyrics now start centered instead of pinned to the top.
- Opening the lyrics now jumps straight to the current line instead of doing a
  fast scroll from the top.
- Softened the cover-derived background color so text and controls stay legible
  on any artwork.
